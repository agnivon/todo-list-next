# To-Do List App

This is a simple to-do list application built using Next.js - a React framework that allows for easy development of web and native applications. This app is designed to run seamlessly on any browser, making it accessible and convenient for users across different platforms.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete tasks to manage your to-do list efficiently.
- Seamlessly switch between browser and native app modes for flexibility and convenience.
- User-friendly interface for a smooth and intuitive experience.

## Getting Started
To run the development server, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application.

You can start modifying the application by editing the `pages/index.tsx` file. The page will automatically update as you make changes.

API routes can be accessed via http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be modified in the `pages/api/hello.ts` file. Files in the `pages/api` directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
